I am Sanz, currently in my 3rd year as an IT student.
- i love programming in JAVA
- almost a year coding in PHP (still a novice)
- recently introduced myself in git
- trying to learn javascript and jquery
- trying to casually learn API/REST
- wanting to learn bootstrap
- wanting to familiarize PYTHON
- Learning the Linux environment so that
- I can create a Web Server at home
- And try to host my site remotely
- wanting to learn PHP framework: Laravel
There is not much to learn at school, they teach us
heavily on stuffs like theories and models of software 
development, also the documentation and management part
and not much on actual programming. We hardly touch
OOP in our curiculum and I have just been told that
without advance knowledge of OOP, then there is not
much opportunity in IT industry.

Anyway, This project is a continuation project from our
System Analysis and Design into our current subject :
Software Engineering. Our objective is to polish our system
add more features and functions and eventually deploy it. 

thats about it i gez.
